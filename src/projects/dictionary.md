    Dictionary App: A Frontend Mentor Challenge
blurb: React Context shines in this jaunty web app that uses the Free Dictionary API to search for all your favorite words. Give it a go. 
description: My solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge uses React and Sass. The component calls the Free Dictioanry API after users enter their given search word. The dark mode toggle and keyboard navigation accessible gives it extra usability. I used Sass loops and mixins to create the theme toggle and React Context to pass data. This web app also uses the audio HTML elment and useRef to give functionality to the "play" button. It was a great project to help boost my React Hook knowledge!
