blurb: The website I think the best gaming channel in the world deserves. This redesign focuses on creator content, community, and merch.
description: The website I think the best gaming channel in the world deserves. With almost 3 million subscribers, Neebs Gaming is well on their way to producing some of the most watched gaming content on YouTube. My goal in this redesign was to showcase their content, create dedicated pages for news, live events and merchandise, and build a space for fans like me to geek out. Checkout the Figma design files to see the before and after shots.
