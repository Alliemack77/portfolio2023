blurb: A fully responsive app built with React hooks and Sass. Cross off your to-do list in style with this functional app, complete with a dark mode toggle.
description: Your Daily Todos is a solution to the Todo App challenge on Frontend Mentor. This is a fully responsive app built with React hooks and Sass. Users can add, delete, mark entries as complete, filter todos by status and clear all completed todos. The dark mode toggle was created using Sass mixins, lists and variables. I also used local storage to store user todos between page renders.
