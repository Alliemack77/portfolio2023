blurb: OpenAI's powerful API can generate just about anything! Add an Express backend and a React frontend and you've got entertainment for hours!   
description: I built this project because I was curious about what it was like to work with OpenAI's API. In this mini app, users input a string of text, hit generate and get back audio spoken by OpenAI's Alloy. Once a user hits 'generate', React sends the collected form data to the Express backend, which then passes the request on to OpenAI. It may be overkill for this small project, but I knew that accessing OpenAI's API would involve an API key, so I wanted to create a secure place to store it (especially since it costs real money to use the API). Plus setting up a server and establishing routes is fun and easy with Express! Take a look at the readme file on GitHub to see a gif of this app in action.
