blurb: Exploring layout and Sass in this landing page inspired by magazine layouts and Nashville nightclubs. This is a fully responsive landing page with an attitude.
description: My favorite part of frontend development is styling with Sass. A goal of the project was to build a landing page with a magazine type of layout. I wanted to build a page with mood, one that reflected a dark and smokey jazz club. I used CSS Grid to overlap page elements, properties like clip-path/:/ polygon() to create vivid shapes, and a custom linear-gradient to move the eye along the page, almost like the strings of a guitar. The Music Shop, a fictitious recording studio in downtown Nashville, is a jazzy trip into the luscious underbelly of CSS.
