blurb: Content management is fun again when you use the best static site generator in the world, Eleventy! Going back to school never felt so good.
description: This is a marketing website I built for the Graduate and Professional Studies at Goucher College. The site is built with Eleventy, a fast and flexible template-based static site generator. There was a tight turn around for this project (1 week!), so I knew I needed something quick and reliable. This site relys on Eleventy's pagination feature, which allows you to generate unique URL's from a json file. This was a huge part of my decision to use Eleventy for the project, because the client requested each of the eight degree programs have a URL for marketing and admissions tracking. The CSS architecture is based on Atomic CSS, using classes to bring in specific styles for typography, spacing, and layout, among others. The result is a lively and easily maintained site where updating content is as easy as ABC!
