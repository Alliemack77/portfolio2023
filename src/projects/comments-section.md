blurb: A compact component, built in React and using the Comments Section API I created. Styling is done using my favorite pre-processor, Sass.
description: This project is my solution to the Interactive Comments Section challenge on Frontend Mentor. This is a fully responsive component built with React and Sass. Users can post, edit, upvote/downvote, reply to, and delete comments. I learned how to build a custom hook that allows for rendering elements based on the viewport size. The Comments are populated by fetching data from an API I built. I also learned accessability best practices for buttons without text, making this commponent keyboard navigation and screen reader friendly.
