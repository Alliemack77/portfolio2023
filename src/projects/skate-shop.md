blurb: Exploring the latest in design and layout tools in this landing page inspired by the e-skateboard Mellow. Find your Cali vibe in this chill landing page with a groove.
description: I love learning by doing. I designed and built this landing page to explore layouts using Flexbox and a mobile first workflow. The result is a fully responsive site that works on a multitude of devices. One of the biggest take-aways is the use of clamp() with font-size to create responsive typography. This project forever changed the way I author CSS, and solidified my understanding of Flexbox.
