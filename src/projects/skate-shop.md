blurb: Exploring layout and CSS in this landing page inspired by the e-skateboard Mellow. Find your Cali vibe in this chill landing page with a groove.
description: I love learning by doing. I designed this landing page to explore building layouts with Flexbox and a mobile first workflow. The result is a fully responsive site that works on a multitude of devices. I especially love the use of clamp() with font-size to create responsive typography.
