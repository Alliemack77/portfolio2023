blurb: My adventures in designing the ultimate Doctor Who experience. Figma is the star in this design for a blog that aims to be as timeless as the Doctor herself. Whovians unite!
description: The Vortex Project is a blog dedicated to all things Doctor Who. I'm a huge fan of the BBC series, and wanted to show my love while diving deeper into my frontend  design skills. I also created a web scraper to inject news articles scraped from the BBC's Doctor Who homepage, as well as a Doctor Who API I hosted on Heroku. This is very much a labor of love. Feel free to explore all the timey-wimey bits in the design files and repo below.
