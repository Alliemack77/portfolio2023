blurb: My adventures in building the ultimate Doctor Who experience. Figma, React, and Sass help build a blog that aims to be as timeless as the Doctor herself. Whovians unite!
description: The Vortex Project is a website dedicated to all things Doctor Who. I'm a huge fan of the BBC series, and wanted to show my love while diving deeper into my frontend skills. The website includes a web scraper to inject news articles scraped from the BBC's Doctor Who homepage, as well as consuming data from the Doctor Who API I created. The goal of this project was to build a React app from scratch, without the use of create-react-app. This project is still in development, so no live site yet, but feel free to explore the design files and repo below.
