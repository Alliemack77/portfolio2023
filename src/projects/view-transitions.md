blurb: Slide in and explore the coolest API since, well ever. Whether you're using the default crossfade or custom CSS animations, this API is like a salve for your animation weary soul.
description: The View Transition API allows developers to easily create custom transitions between different states and pages. Smooth transitions can reduce the effort needed to navigate, can help users understand where they are within your site, and can making pages feel faster and more responsive. In this video tutorial I demonstrate how to leverage the crossfade provided by the API, and even show how to customize the transitions using CSS animations.
